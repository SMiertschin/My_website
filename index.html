	<h1>A unique girl who enjoys traveling and people.</h1>
		<p>This summer I was in Greensboro, NC. It was warm there. Last spring I studied 
abroad in Cape Coast, Ghana. The year before that I spent a week in Jamaica. That same year I 
went on a cruise and spent more time in North Carolina. I have also visited the United Kingdom, 
Australia, Canada, and Hawaii. And I've been to nearly all of the states in the United 
States. 
I like traveling. </p>
